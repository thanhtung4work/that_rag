# Simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

This project implements a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The system retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base in response to a user query and then uses a generative model to produce a context-aware response based on the retrieved information.

## Key Components

1. **Data source:** A knowledge base with a collection of documents.

2. **Retrieval system:** A vector-based search to retrieve relevant documents.

3. **Generator Model:** A generative model that produces a final answer based on the query and retrieved documents.
